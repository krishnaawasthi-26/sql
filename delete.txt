Let’s move on to the next SQL command in our in-depth exploration! We’ve covered `SELECT`, `INSERT`, and `UPDATE`. Now, we’ll dive into the `DELETE` command.

### SQL Command: `DELETE`

The `DELETE` command is used to remove existing rows from a table. It’s a Data Manipulation Language (DML) command, like `INSERT` and `UPDATE`, and is used to delete data while leaving the table structure intact. Unlike `DROP` (a DDL command that removes entire tables), `DELETE` targets specific rows or all rows based on conditions.

#### Syntax:
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name
[WHERE condition];
```

- **`table_name`**: The table from which rows will be deleted.
- **`WHERE`**: Optional condition to specify which rows to remove (if omitted, all rows are deleted).

#### Key Points:
1. **Purpose**: Removes rows from a table, reducing its row count.
2. **Structure**: 
   - `DELETE FROM`: Identifies the table.
   - `WHERE`: Filters which rows to delete.
3. **Effect**: Only removes data, not the table itself or its schema (columns, constraints, etc.).
4. **Constraints**: Must respect referential integrity (e.g., foreign key constraints may prevent deletion).

#### Examples:
1. **Deleting a Single Row**:
   ```sql
   DELETE FROM employees
   WHERE employee_id = 101;
   ```
   - Removes the employee with `employee_id` 101.

2. **Deleting Multiple Rows**:
   ```sql
   DELETE FROM employees
   WHERE department = 'Sales';
   ```
   - Deletes all employees in the Sales department.

3. **Deleting All Rows (No `WHERE`)**:
   ```sql
   DELETE FROM products;
   ```
   - Removes all rows from the `products` table, leaving it empty but still existing.

4. **Using a Condition with Multiple Criteria**:
   ```sql
   DELETE FROM orders
   WHERE order_date < '2024-01-01' AND status = 'Cancelled';
   ```
   - Deletes cancelled orders from before 2024.

#### Components of `DELETE`:
In standard SQL, `DELETE` is minimalistic compared to `SELECT` or even `UPDATE`. It has one main clause and an optional filter:

1. **FROM Clause**:
   - **Purpose**: Specifies the table to delete from. In standard SQL, it’s written as `DELETE FROM`.
   - **Syntax**: 
     ```sql
     DELETE FROM table_name
     ```
   - **Details**: Mandatory; identifies the target table.
   - **Example**:
     ```sql
     DELETE FROM employees;
     ```

2. **WHERE Clause**:
   - **Purpose**: Filters which rows to delete.
   - **Syntax**: 
     ```sql
     WHERE condition
     ```
   - **Details**: 
     - Optional; if omitted, all rows are deleted.
     - Uses the same syntax as `WHERE` in `SELECT` and `UPDATE` (e.g., `=`, `<`, `LIKE`, `IN`, etc.).
   - **Example**:
     ```sql
     DELETE FROM employees
     WHERE salary < 30000;
     ```

#### Database-Specific Extensions:
Some databases add optional clauses to enhance `DELETE`:

3. **USING Clause (PostgreSQL)**:
   - **Purpose**: Specifies additional tables for joining, similar to `FROM` in `UPDATE`.
   - **Syntax**: 
     ```sql
     DELETE FROM table_name
     USING another_table
     WHERE condition;
     ```
   - **Details**: Allows deletion based on data from another table.
   - **Example**:
     ```sql
     DELETE FROM employees e
     USING departments d
     WHERE e.department_id = d.id AND d.department_name = 'HR';
     ```
     - Deletes employees in the HR department.

4. **JOIN Clause (MySQL)**:
   - **Purpose**: Allows joining tables to determine which rows to delete.
   - **Syntax**: 
     ```sql
     DELETE table_name
     FROM table_name
     JOIN another_table ON condition
     [WHERE condition];
     ```
   - **Details**: MySQL-specific; can use `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, etc.
   - **Example**:
     ```sql
     DELETE e
     FROM employees e
     INNER JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id
     WHERE d.department_name = 'Marketing';
     ```
     - Deletes Marketing employees.
   - **Variation**: In MySQL, you can also delete from multiple tables in one statement:
     ```sql
     DELETE e, d
     FROM employees e
     JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id
     WHERE d.department_name = 'Sales';
     ```
     - Deletes matching rows from both `employees` and `departments`.

5. **RETURNING Clause (PostgreSQL)**:
   - **Purpose**: Returns the deleted rows (or specific columns) after the delete.
   - **Syntax**: 
     ```sql
     DELETE FROM table_name
     [WHERE condition]
     RETURNING column1, column2, ...;
     ```
   - **Example**:
     ```sql
     DELETE FROM employees
     WHERE employee_id = 103
     RETURNING employee_id, first_name;
     ```
     - Returns the `employee_id` and `first_name` of the deleted row.

6. **ORDER BY and LIMIT Clauses (MySQL, PostgreSQL)**:
   - **Purpose**: Controls the order and number of rows deleted.
   - **Syntax**: 
     ```sql
     DELETE FROM table_name
     [WHERE condition]
     ORDER BY column
     LIMIT n;
     ```
   - **Details**: Non-standard; restricts deletion to a specific number of rows.
   - **Example**:
     ```sql
     DELETE FROM employees
     WHERE status = 'Inactive'
     ORDER BY hire_date ASC
     LIMIT 5;
     ```
     - Deletes the 5 oldest inactive employees.

#### Notes:
- **Safety**: Always use a `WHERE` clause unless you intend to empty the table, as there’s no automatic "undo."
- **Performance**: Deleting all rows with `DELETE` (without `WHERE`) can be slower than `TRUNCATE` (a DDL command), which also resets auto-increment counters.
- **Constraints**: Foreign key constraints may block deletion unless `ON DELETE CASCADE` or similar is configured.
- **Empty Table**: After `DELETE`, the table remains in the database (unlike `DROP TABLE`).

#### Practical Use Case:
Suppose you need to clean up old records:
```sql
DELETE FROM orders
WHERE order_date < '2023-01-01';
```
- Removes all orders before 2023.

#### Summary of Clauses:
- **Standard SQL**: 
  - `FROM` (mandatory, as `DELETE FROM`)
  - `WHERE` (optional)
- **Database-Specific**:
  - `USING` (PostgreSQL)
  - `JOIN` (MySQL)
  - `RETURNING` (PostgreSQL)
  - `ORDER BY` (MySQL, PostgreSQL with `LIMIT`)
  - `LIMIT` (MySQL, PostgreSQL)

Since `DELETE` is straightforward, I’ve covered its standard and extended clauses in one turn. Let me know if you have doubts about `DELETE`, or say "next" to move on to another SQL command (e.g., `CREATE TABLE` or `ALTER TABLE`)!

------------------------------
I assume you’re asking about the `RETURNING` clause, which I mentioned as a database-specific extension for the `DELETE` command (and also available in `INSERT` and `UPDATE` in some databases like PostgreSQL). Since it’s not part of standard SQL and is most commonly associated with PostgreSQL, I’ll explain its purpose and functionality in detail, focusing on how it works with `DELETE` (and briefly noting its use in other commands for completeness).

### What Does the `RETURNING` Clause Do?

The `RETURNING` clause is a PostgreSQL-specific feature that allows you to retrieve data from the rows affected by a `DELETE`, `INSERT`, or `UPDATE` operation. When used with `DELETE`, it returns the rows that were deleted (or specific columns from those rows) as a result set, similar to how a `SELECT` statement returns data. This is particularly useful for confirming what was deleted, logging changes, or capturing values (like IDs) for further use in a script or application.

#### Syntax with `DELETE`:
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name
[WHERE condition]
RETURNING column1, column2, ...;
```

- **`RETURNING`**: Specifies which columns (or expressions) from the deleted rows to return.
- **Output**: Produces a result set containing the requested data from the rows that were removed.

#### Key Points:
1. **Purpose**: Returns data from the rows deleted by the `DELETE` statement, allowing you to see or use the deleted data immediately.
2. **Database**: Primarily PostgreSQL (not available in MySQL, SQL Server, or standard ANSI SQL).
3. **Flexibility**: You can return specific columns, all columns (using `*`), or even computed expressions.
4. **Use Case**: Useful in scripts, triggers, or applications where you need to know what was deleted (e.g., for auditing or chaining operations).

#### Examples with `DELETE`:
1. **Returning Specific Columns**:
   ```sql
   DELETE FROM employees
   WHERE employee_id = 101
   RETURNING employee_id, first_name, last_name;
   ```
   - Deletes the row where `employee_id` is 101 and returns the `employee_id`, `first_name`, and `last_name` of the deleted row.
   - **Possible Output**:
     ```
     employee_id | first_name | last_name
     ------------+------------+-----------
     101         | John       | Doe
     ```

2. **Returning All Columns**:
   ```sql
   DELETE FROM employees
   WHERE department = 'Sales'
   RETURNING *;
   ```
   - Deletes all Sales employees and returns all columns from the deleted rows.
   - **Possible Output** (if two rows were deleted):
     ```
     employee_id | first_name | last_name | department | salary
     ------------+------------+-----------+------------+--------
     102         | Alice      | Smith     | Sales      | 55000
     103         | Bob        | Jones     | Sales      | 60000
     ```

3. **Returning an Expression**:
   ```sql
   DELETE FROM orders
   WHERE order_date < '2024-01-01'
   RETURNING order_id, (amount * 0.9) AS discounted_amount;
   ```
   - Deletes old orders and returns their `order_id` along with a computed discounted amount (90% of the original `amount`).
   - **Possible Output**:
     ```
     order_id | discounted_amount
     ---------+-------------------
     1        | 90.00
     2        | 45.00
     ```

#### How It Works:
- **Execution**: PostgreSQL processes the `DELETE` operation first, identifies the rows that match the `WHERE` condition (if any), deletes them, and *then* constructs a result set from those deleted rows based on the `RETURNING` specification.
- **Result**: The output is returned as a table-like result, which can be:
  - Viewed directly in an interactive SQL client (e.g., psql).
  - Captured in a variable or used in a larger query/script in a programming context.

#### `RETURNING` in Other Commands:
Since you asked about `RETURNING` in the context of `DELETE`, here’s a quick note on its use elsewhere in PostgreSQL:
- **With `INSERT`**:
  ```sql
  INSERT INTO employees (first_name, last_name)
  VALUES ('Jane', 'Doe')
  RETURNING employee_id;
  ```
  - Returns the auto-generated `employee_id` of the new row (great for getting IDs without a separate query).
- **With `UPDATE`**:
  ```sql
  UPDATE employees
  SET salary = 70000
  WHERE employee_id = 102
  RETURNING employee_id, salary;
  ```
  - Returns the updated `employee_id` and new `salary`.

#### Practical Use Cases:
1. **Auditing**: Log deleted records before they’re gone:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO deleted_employees_log (emp_id, name, deletion_date)
   SELECT employee_id, first_name, CURRENT_DATE
   FROM (
       DELETE FROM employees
       WHERE status = 'Inactive'
       RETURNING employee_id, first_name
   ) AS deleted;
   ```
   - Deletes inactive employees and logs them.

2. **Chaining Operations**: Use deleted IDs elsewhere:
   ```sql
   WITH deleted AS (
       DELETE FROM orders
       WHERE order_date < '2023-01-01'
       RETURNING order_id
   )
   INSERT INTO archived_orders (order_id, archived_date)
   SELECT order_id, CURRENT_DATE FROM deleted;
   ```
   - Deletes old orders and archives their IDs.

#### Notes:
- **Not Standard**: `RETURNING` is PostgreSQL-specific. In other databases, you’d need a separate `SELECT` before or after the `DELETE` to achieve similar results.
- **Performance**: Adds minimal overhead since PostgreSQL already knows which rows are affected.
- **No Undo**: The rows are still deleted; `RETURNING` just gives you a snapshot of what was removed.

### Summary:
The `RETURNING` clause in PostgreSQL’s `DELETE` lets you retrieve the data from deleted rows as a result set. It’s like adding a “show me what I just deleted” feature to the command, making it powerful for tracking changes or integrating with other operations.

Does this clarify what `RETURNING` does? Let me know if you have more questions about it or want to explore it further! Otherwise, say "next" to move on to the next SQL command (e.g., `CREATE TABLE`).
